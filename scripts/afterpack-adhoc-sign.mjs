// electron-builder afterPack hook — re-sign the packed macOS app ad-hoc.
//
// Runs after the .app is assembled and before the dmg/zip are built from it, so
// the signature ends up inside the artifact people download.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// Electron's prebuilt binary arrives linker-signed ad-hoc. electron-builder then
// writes the app into the bundle and, with no signing identity configured, does
// not re-sign — so the seal no longer matches its contents. Gatekeeper reports
// that as a BROKEN signature:
//
//   code has no resources but signature indicates they must be present
//
// which is the "Mission Gontrol is damaged and can't be opened" dialog, and macOS
// offers no override for it: Privacy & Security shows no "Open Anyway" button,
// so the only way in is `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`.
//
// Re-sealing the whole bundle ad-hoc makes the signature VALID while still being
// anonymous (no Developer ID, no Team ID). Gatekeeper then rejects it as an
// unidentified developer instead of as damaged — which is the flow that does
// offer "Open Anyway" in Privacy & Security.
//
// This is not a substitute for a Developer ID and notarization; it just moves the
// failure to the one macOS lets a user consciously accept. With real credentials
// (CSC_LINK + APPLE_*), set mac.identity and drop this hook.
